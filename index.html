                Well, maybe we're not the best nor the biggest bicycle shop in the city, but you can sense our passion for cycles the moment you enter through the door, the way we've curated our shop with. 
              </p>
              <p>
              Sometimes we think if our shelves could talk they'd thank us for letting them hold some of the finest local & imported cycles of our time. And almost all of the cycles were recommended by some and many of our cycle enthusiastic friends, so they might get thanks too. 
              <p>
              And again if our tea kettle could talk it would tell you how many happy faces it has served! Maybe it'll feel blessed to serve you too, who knows!

          If you already own a bike, you're cordially invited to visit our servicing section. You can see here the way we operate (yeah we call it surgery) on bikes that needs a refreshing new start and hopefully let us fine-tune your's too.
